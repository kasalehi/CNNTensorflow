# CNNTensorflow

This project contains two diffrent model using the tensorflow.
First, hands on preparing data then claen and renormalize the data.
Secondly, we create the baseline model tyhen using some meythods like data augmentaiton, sfuffling and renormalizing the data we imporove the model ti avoid the overfitting or underfitting.
Thirdly, we use the helper function to make the custom image more appropriate for prediction.
